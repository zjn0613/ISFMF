# Image Shape Feature Matrix Factorization (ISFMF)

### Overview
> Recommender system is an information-ﬁltering tool used in solving the problem that the user’s preference in information overload. In recent years, some algorithms have been combined with some side information (i.e., item description documents, user reviews, and social networks), and rating prediction accuracy has been signiﬁcantly improved. However, for fashionable goods, such as apparel and shoes that are important for designing, the contextual information of items is insufﬁcient, and their image shape feature should be considered. Currently, no such recommender system is available to use this feature of image shape. This study proposes a novel probabilistic model using the image shape feature that integrates a convolutional neural network into the probabilistic matrix factorization. The experiment conducted on two real-world datasets corroborates that our model outperforms the other recommendation models.

### Requirements

- Python 3.5
- Keras 2.0

### How to Run

Note: Run `python <install_path>/run.py -h` in bash shell. You will see how to configure several parameters

### Configuration
You can evaluate our model with different settings in terms of the size of dimension, the value of hyperparameter, the number of convolutional kernal, and etc. Below is a description of all the configurable parameters and their defaults:
